Notes:

* The strains labeled as '-N/A-' are the ones where I was not able to identify their correct name.

* I chose 131x15 in the worm map (the default). I can get a nicer image with 263x31, but the files are just to big. If I want to use higher textural detail I could come back to this later.

* I accept the label 'unknown' for the ventral_side, but I do not calculate the intensity map neither its features.
